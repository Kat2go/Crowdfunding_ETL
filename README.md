# ETL Mini Project
Project 2
For this Data Analytics Boot Camp Project, Triston Cavanness, Katrina Brown, and Lesley Conn continued their classtime partnership to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data.
Katrina Brown developed the crowdfunding database; Triston Cavaness developed campaign dataframe and Lesley Conn developed the contact dataframe using the option of the Panda dictionaries. Katrina Brown created the repository and, based on team input, developed the schema.
The team communicated and collaborated throughout the project to complete the work early in the holiday weekend. The night before the project was due, the main file and branch files were corrupted in GitHub, requiring the rebuilding of more than a third of the work.
