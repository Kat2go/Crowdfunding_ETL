# ETL Mini Project
Project 2
For this Data Analytics Boot Camp Project, Triston Cavanness, Katrina Brown, and Lesley Conn continued their classtime partnership to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data.
Katrina Brown developed the crowdfunding database; Triston Cavaness developed campaign dataframe and Lesley Conn developed the contact dataframe using the option of the Panda dictionaries. Katrina Brown created the repository and, based on team input, developed the schema.
Each team member cloned the repository, developed sections of code in local repositories and pushed updates to GitHub, then merged files. The team communicated and collaborated throughout the project to complete the work early in the holiday weekend. 
Once dataframes were built, the project required renaming columns, changing data types and converting UTC time into datetime formats.
The night before the project was due, the main file and branch files were corrupted in GitHub, requiring the rebuilding of more than a third of the work.
The project was submitted successfully by the deadline. TA Carlos Fernandez assisted throughout the reconstruction.
